# Fundamentals & Basic Algorithms

This module covers the foundational concepts and basic algorithms that form the building blocks of machine learning.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Implement K-Nearest Neighbors for both classification and regression
- Understand data representation and feature engineering
- Apply clustering algorithms to group similar data points
- Reduce dimensionality using PCA and other embedding techniques
- Evaluate model performance and understand generalization

## Topics Covered

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
- **K-NN Classification**: Implementing nearest neighbor classification from scratch
- **Data Representation**: Understanding feature vectors, distance metrics, and data preprocessing
- **K-NN Regression**: Extending K-NN to continuous target variables
- **Generalization**: Cross-validation, overfitting, and model selection

### 2. Search and Clustering
- **Clustering Algorithms**: K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN
- **Search Techniques**: Efficient nearest neighbor search, KD-trees
- **Similarity Metrics**: Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, Manhattan distance
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Silhouette score, inertia, cluster validation

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Linear dimensionality reduction
- **Embeddings**: Word embeddings, feature embeddings, t-SNE
- **Feature Selection**: Filter methods, wrapper methods, embedded methods
- **Visualization**: 2D/3D projections of high-dimensional data

## Practical Applications

- **Recommendation Systems**: Finding similar users or items
- **Image Recognition**: Basic image classification using pixel features
- **Document Clustering**: Grouping similar documents or articles
- **Data Visualization**: Exploring high-dimensional datasets

## Implementation Focus

This module emphasizes **hands-on implementation**:
- Code K-NN from scratch in Python
- Implement clustering algorithms without using sklearn
- Build PCA step-by-step using numpy
- Create interactive visualizations

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming
