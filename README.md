# Applied Machine Learning (AML)

> **Note**: This repository is currently under construction. The curriculum and materials are being developed and will be updated regularly.

## Overview

Welcome to the Applied Machine Learning! This curriculum is designed to teach you how to implement and apply machine learning algorithms in practice. We focus on **practical skills** and giving you the tools to make these algorithms work effectively in real-world scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this curriculum, you will be able to:

- **Implement** core machine learning algorithms from scratch
- **Apply** these algorithms to real-world problems
- **Understand** the underlying mathematics and theory
- **Build** complete machine learning systems
- **Evaluate** and optimize model performance
- **Deploy** machine learning solutions

## Prerequisites

Before starting this curriculum, you should have:

- **Programming Experience**: At the level of a second-semester college CS program
  - Proficiency in Python (preferred) or similar programming language
  - Understanding of data structures and algorithms
  - Experience with object-oriented programming
- **Mathematics Foundation**: Basic linear algebra
  - Vectors and matrices
  - Matrix operations (multiplication, inversion)
  - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  - Basic calculus concepts

## Curriculum Structure

### 1. **Supervised Learning Algorithms**
- **Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous values
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary and multi-class classification
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Classification with maximum margin
- **Neural Networks & Deep Learning**: Multi-layer perceptrons and modern architectures

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms**
- **K-Means Clustering**: Grouping similar data points
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA and other techniques
- **Association Rules**: Finding patterns in data

### 3. **Specialized Applications**
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns
- **Recommender Systems**: Building recommendation engines
- **Natural Language Processing**: Text analysis and processing

### 4. **Practical Skills**
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation and validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment and production considerations

## Final Project

The curriculum culminates in an **open-ended final project** where you will:

- Choose a real-world problem to solve
- Apply the algorithms and techniques learned
- Build a complete machine learning system
- Present your findings and solution

## Learning Resources
