# Applied Machine Learning (AML)

> **Note**: This repository is currently under construction. The curriculum and materials are being developed and will be updated regularly.

## Overview

Welcome to Applied Machine Learning! This curriculum is designed to teach you how to implement and apply machine learning algorithms in practice. We focus on **practical skills** and giving you the tools to make these algorithms work effectively in real-world scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this curriculum, you will be able to:

- **Implement** core machine learning algorithms from scratch
- **Apply** these algorithms to real-world problems
- **Understand** the underlying mathematics and theory
- **Build** complete machine learning systems
- **Evaluate** and optimize model performance
- **Deploy** machine learning solutions

## Prerequisites

Before starting this curriculum, you should have:
